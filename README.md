## ðŸ“– Background
You work in the HR department of a large company. The board is concerned about the relatively high turnover, and your team needs to look at ways to reduce the number of employees leaving the company.

The team needs to better understand the situation and identify which employees are more likely to leave the company and why. Once it's clear what variables are affecting employee churn, you can present your findings along with your ideas for approaching the problem.

 ## How it is done
We explore the dataset with Exploratory Data Analysis and infer which variables are related to employees leaving the company in various stages of their tenure. We apply statistical tests to find significant variables that need to be interpreted and finally be a foundation for conclusions and recommendations towards lowering employee churn.
